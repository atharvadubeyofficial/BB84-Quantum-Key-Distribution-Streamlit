# 🌐 BB84 Quantum Key Distribution – Phase 3 (Live Streamlit App)

Welcome to **Phase 3** of the BB84 Quantum Cyber Defense Simulator project. This version brings the entire BB84 logic, encryption-decryption, and Eve detection system to a **publicly accessible live web application**, powered by **Streamlit**.

✅ Live Web: [Click to Open the Simulation](https://atharva-bb84-quantum-key-distribution-app.streamlit.app/)

## ⚡ What's Included in Phase 3?
- ✅ 100% Web-based deployment using Streamlit
- 🔐 Real-time encryption & decryption using BB84-generated key
- 🚨 Eve detection logic based on quantum error rate
- 📉 Mismatched photon indices shown for error insight
- 🧠 Full randomness & practical feel added via noise simulation
- 🛰️ Clear status of secure/compromised channels shown
- 🧑‍💻 Deployed for public testing & awareness

## 🔭 Vision
To make quantum cryptography **accessible and testable** for everyone – from students to researchers to national defense stakeholders. This web version showcases how such protocols could be embedded in **critical communication systems** between **satellites, ground stations**, and **strategic control centers**.

## 🚀 Built With
- Streamlit
- Python
- Base64 for secure encoding
- Random noise-based logic for realism because I'm trying to build something big for nation 🇮🇳 not only limited to simulations or hypothetical projects...
- In this simulation here you will get random eve cases in each and every trial also with noise factor.

Still working....more updates coming soon...
Thanks for reading
